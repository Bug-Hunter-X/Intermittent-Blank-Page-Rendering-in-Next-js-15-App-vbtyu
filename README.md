# Next.js 15 Intermittent Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in a Next.js 15 application where the page intermittently renders a blank screen instead of the expected content.  The issue is inconsistent and does not always reproduce reliably.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior.  The page may render correctly, or it may display a blank screen.  Refreshing the page or making seemingly unrelated code changes can sometimes resolve the issue.

## Potential Causes

The cause of the bug remains under investigation.  Potential causes include:

* **Caching issues:**  Aggressive caching on the server or client-side.
* **Unexpected runtime errors:**  Errors during the rendering process might be swallowed and not properly reported.
* **Race conditions:**  Asynchronous operations within the application might lead to race conditions.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a potential workaround. Further investigation and testing are required to confirm the ultimate solution and ensure full stability.
